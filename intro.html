			<h1 class="text-center">Dawson Webb</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				This is the more indepth look at who I am, stuff the home page did not touch on. I am a 20 year old, aspiring programmer. I consider myself to be easy going and an easy learner. If you asked people who know me to explain who <b>Dawson Webb</b> is, they would say that I have a comedic and charming personality. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Through commedy, I like to put a smile on someones face or make them laugh. Some might not find me as funny as others but I will try and make everyone laugh. People would say I am a charming person because I want everyone to like me not because I am self concious about others but because I want to minimize the negativity in people. I have made it a mindset to try and give everyone a chance.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am very forgiving and like being around people. I do not like being negative and I strive to have a positive outlook on life.
